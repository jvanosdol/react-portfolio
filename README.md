## React-Portfolio

## Author

James Van Osdol

## Description

This project demonstrates basic knowledge of react.js. This is a portfolio showing off previous projects over the course of the bootcamp. The projects that are displayed show a screenshot and are clickable, allowing the user to navigate to the live project site. 

This portfolio is not fully complete unfortunately, but I will manage to rework it in the near future.
